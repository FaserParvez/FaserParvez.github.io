									<p>The module specification site is a project that I have worked on for the University of Huddersfield. The project started off by doing a one year placement for my Computing Bsc degree course at the university. I was set up to create a system that would store module specification documentation onto an online system. The departments that I have been working with to set up the project were Computing and Engineering school and the Cooperate Information System team at the Computing and Library services. The system was carried on through my final year project for my degree and further developed to expand onto programme specification documents and expanding onto other schools at the university.</p>
									<p>The system was a web based application that would allow the Computing and Engineering schools to view module specifications online and make changes. The database would be held in the main central building with other university systems while schools would be able to edit the documents. The system would allow staff members to make changes to their specification and a process would go through of validation checks. This would send emails to other staff members who are in charge of checking the changes made and to validate the documents before accepting the changes.</p>
									<p>Features that were included into the system were a search engine to find module specifications, to view and edit module specification depending on the staff member who owns the document. An advanced login system would have different access levels to the system. A validation process of checking the changes made with the documents and who has checked the documents.</p>
									<p>Below is a table to show the type of software and skills I have used in order to make this system. If you would like more information, feel free to view the PDF document of my final year report or github page of code examples above.</p>
