								<p>This is a project that was developed with C++ within Eclipse. The purpose of this project was to create a database system while using C++ and SQLite that would store video game information. With C++ and Linux, a system was developed by having a client and server which would allow a user to enter game information, which then that information would be stored into a database in the server side. The user would be using a command window as a GUI in order to access the information.</p>
								<p>The main features that were included into this project where that the user would be able view a list of all the game information in the database. The user could also view an individual game information than all. A search function that would allow the user to filter which game they would want to find. For example they could filter the database by genre. Finally the user is able to enter a new game product into the database.</p>
								<p>The software and skills that were used to develop this can be seen on the below table. I have also included a github page of the coding for this system above if you wish to view.</p>
